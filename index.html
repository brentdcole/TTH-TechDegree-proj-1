        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I’m an aspiring web developer with an exciting new-found love for technology. I was born and raised in Aurora, Illinois and have worked in
            underground construction for most of my career. During that time, I was educated by experienced civil engineers on how to be proficient in the installation,
            rehabilitation, and functionality of underground infrastructure. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building professional, interactive, and attractive websites.</p>
          <!-- <p>I was a Journeyman, Sewer and Tunnel Craftworker of underground machinery in Chicago, Illinois operating CCTV equipment and enjoyed it very much. After moving to Colorado, during the
            quarantine I was able to start studying programming languages and have found a new calling. </p> -->
