        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I’m an aspiring web developer with an exciting new-found love for technology.</p>
          <p>I was born and raised in Aurora, Illinois and have worked in
          underground construction for most of my career. During that time, I was educated by experienced civil engineers on how to be proficient in the installation,
          rehabilitation, and functionality of underground infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I'm interested in building things and leaving my mark on projects so I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building professional, interactive, and attractive websites.</p>

      <div class="background_goals-container">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>I'm seeking the knowledge to master the process of building web sites and look forward to augmenting my skills and abilities in:</p>
            <ul class="skills">
