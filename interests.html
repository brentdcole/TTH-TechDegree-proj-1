      <h4>Climbing</h4>
        <p>Rock climbing is one of the few things I truly love. I began climbing a few years ago, when a friend asked me to join him and some others.
          After the first experience I bought all the gear I needed and trained nearly everyday.</p>
          <p>Starting in the gym I built up the endurance, knowledge, and strength to move outdoors. Being from the midwest, it's very difficult
            to get to real rock without driving for hours, which I did regularly. I've sent routes and problems in Wisconsin's Devil's Lake and Governors
            Dodge, Kentucky's Red River Gorge, and Colorado's Clear Creek, North Table, and the town
            of Morrison's front range bouldering area, Black Hole and The Lobby. I even got the chance to climb in Iceland.

      <h4>Motorcycles</h4>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, my old man has been riding. He got me on two wheels around 11 years old when he bought a 90's XR100 from a neighbor.</p>
          <p>Some years later I started racing motocross. After several injuries, and having my bike stolen, I got on a street bike. Yamaha has always been a
            favorite, and that's what you see here. <p>1000cc motor with all (besides the flash tune..) the aftermarket work done by me.</p>

      <h4>Drumming</h4>
        <p>Music has been a part of my life for the longest. A good friend in school sparked an interest in guitar and from there, I started lessons, and quickly
          started learning. I played for hours everyday being able to get completely lost in the mass of theory and styles from my favorite artists.
          I've played in a couple bands, recorded some work with friends, and have gotten to play for an audience.
          <p>Eventually, I started listening to more niche styles of music and from there I became obssesed with beats and strange timing, which led me to where I am now with drumming.</p>
